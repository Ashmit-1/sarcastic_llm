## ⚡ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Install `uv`

If you don’t have `uv` installed, install it using:

#### Recommended:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

#### Or you can try:

```bash
pip install uv
```

### 2️⃣ install dependencies 

```bash
uv sync
```

### 3️⃣ Run the main file

```bash
uv run main.py
```

#### Note:
- This is a very small scale LLM so there may be grammatical errors
- Try changing the temperature value in the main.py file to get optimal output
